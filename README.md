# ArchLinuxSetup
POST-INSTALL Script for configuring my user account and computer AFTER installing Arch Linux.

Notes:
Work in progress, there is a lot wrong with how this repository is setup, and some small issues with how the main script makes directories and copies files.
This will be a slow project as things get ironed out.
I do want to include the art I use in this repository (and it is in here), but I need to add the artist names and sources.
There is also some work in here done by others on GitHub, and I will work on crediting them until I'm able to completely replace it with a new concept and code.
In-order to address the issue with their code being included in this repository, I am working on re-writing the script to Git clone these projects instead of having their code in this repository.
My apologies for the mess here. This was intended to be a quick and dirty solution for getting a new image of Linux running ASAP in-case my computer gets nuked or I need to nuke it.
