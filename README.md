# ArchLinuxSetup
POST-INSTALL Script for configuring my user account and computer AFTER installing Arch Linux.

To Do:
1. Edit the script to git clone Chicago95 and move the icons and fonts into the correct places.
2. Figure out how to configure the sounds in Chicago95 for Arch, then edit the script to automate those configurations.
3. Add more to the script for configuring gnome-boxes (might not make sense given how large .ISOs are for downloads.
  3a. I plan to build VMs for RedHat, Kubuntu, OpenSUSE, FreeBSD, Kolibri, MacOS, and Windows 12 (whenever that finally gets released).
4. See how much I can automate in-regards to Wal.
5. Test the InstallMenu.sh script on a new image, then repeat until I get the results I want/need.
6. Remove unnecessary software or duplicate installs.

Notes:
There is still a lot more that can be automated here, but currently this is enough to prevent a re-image from being a very critical issue for daily-life.
It would still cost me an afternoon to run through the whole script and be satisfied enough to slow down, but I can't help but want to iron this out even though I have other things to do lol.
This will eventually go Private, unless I can fix all the assets in here that should be cloned with Git instead of included in this repository.
I am working on fixing this, as well as providing the links/source and Artist names for the Fastfetch and Wallpaper images I'm using for my themes.
