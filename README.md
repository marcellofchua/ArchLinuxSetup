# ArchLinuxSetup
POST-INSTALL Script for configuring my user account and computer AFTER installing Arch Linux.

To Do:
1. Edit the script to git clone Chicago95 and move the icons and fonts into the correct places.
2. Figure out how to configure the sounds in Chicago95 for Arch, then edit the script to automate those configurations.
3. Add more to the script for configuring gnome-boxes (might not make sense given how large .ISOs are for downloads.
  3a. I plan to build VMs for RedHat, Kubuntu, OpenSUSE, FreeBSD, Kolibri, MacOS, and Windows 12 (whenever that finally gets released).
4. Test the InstallMenu.sh script on a new image, then repeat until I get the results I want/need.
